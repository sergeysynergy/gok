# gok

GoK is (not like but) git motivated secret data eater. I mean keeper. 

GophKeeper is a client-server system that allows user to securely and relentlessly store logins, passwords, binary data and other private information.

Use `gok --help` for commands help.

TODO:
- `make install` command for project easy installation.
- More complex password check.
- CIDR check.
- Multiple branch support (now works with one default branch).
